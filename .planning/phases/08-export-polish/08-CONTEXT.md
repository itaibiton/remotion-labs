# Phase 8: Export & Polish — Discussion Context

**Captured:** 2026-01-29
**Phase Goal:** Users can export generated code for standalone Remotion projects

## Discussion Areas

### 1. Export Format

- **Two export options:** Single `.tsx` file download AND zip project scaffold
- **File type:** TypeScript (`.tsx`)
- **Scaffold template:** Claude's discretion (standard Remotion project structure)
- **Zip generation:** Claude's discretion (client-side vs server-side)

### 2. Export Content

- **Imports:** Full imports included (remotion, @remotion/*, react)
- **Composition wrapper:** Include `registerRoot` + `Composition` config so export is a complete entry point
- **Metadata:** Header comments with "Generated by RemotionLab" attribution and original prompt text
- **Component naming:** Keep `MyComposition` (matches existing convention in code generation)

### 3. Trigger & UX

- **Export button location:** Below preview, alongside existing render/download controls
- **Delivery method:** Browser download (standard download dialog)
- No clipboard copy needed
- No confirmation dialog needed

### 4. Standalone Readiness

- **Full scaffold:** `npm install && npm start` must work out of the box
- **Includes:** package.json, tsconfig, remotion config, the component file
- **No README required** — scaffold is self-explanatory with standard Remotion commands

## Key Decisions for Planning

1. Two export paths: quick single-file download + full project zip
2. Both are browser downloads (no server-side zip generation required if client-side works)
3. Export button lives in the render controls area below preview
4. Zip must be a runnable Remotion project (not just component code)
5. Header comments provide attribution and context
6. TypeScript throughout (`.tsx` files, `tsconfig.json` in scaffold)

## Requirements Covered

- **OUT-02**: User can export generated Remotion source code

## Dependencies

- Phase 7 complete: full code generation, editing, and refinement pipeline operational
- `rawCode` field available from generations (JSX source for export)
- Code validation pipeline ensures exported code is valid
