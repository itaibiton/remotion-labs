# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-27)

**Core value:** Users can go from a text prompt to a rendered, downloadable animated video without any coding or motion design knowledge.
**Current focus:** Phase 5 - Render Pipeline (In Progress)

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 5 (Render Pipeline)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-28 - Completed 05-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [########.-] 83%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 10
- Average duration: 5.6 min
- Total execution time: 56 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-auth | 2 | 9 min | 4.5 min |
| 02-generation-pipeline | 3 | 16 min | 5.3 min |
| 03-preview-system | 1 | 12 min | 12 min |
| 04-templates-discovery | 2 | 10 min | 5 min |
| 05-render-pipeline | 1 | 3 min | 3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 03-01 (12 min), 04-01 (2 min), 04-02 (8 min), 05-01 (3 min)
- Trend: Consistent fast execution

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Clerk for authentication (fast integration, good UX, 10K MAU free tier)
- Convex for backend (real-time, serverless, pairs well with React)
- Remotion Lambda for rendering (serverless, scales automatically)
- Template-based generation approach for v1.0 (props-based, not full JSX execution)
- Provider hierarchy: ClerkProvider > ConvexProviderWithClerk (required nesting order)
- Geist font retained from Next.js scaffold (modern, readable)
- Modal-based auth instead of dedicated pages (cleaner UX)
- shadcn/ui for component library (consistent design system)
- Middleware in src/ instead of root (Next.js App Router requirement)
- Zod 4.x for validation (via eslint-plugin-react-hooks dependency)
- Claude claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 for animation generation
- Node.js actions pattern for external API calls
- Internal mutations for action-to-mutation communication
- Sonner for toast notifications (lightweight, modern)
- Step-based progress feedback pattern (analyzing -> generating -> validating)
- Markdown code block stripping for LLM JSON responses
- isMounted pattern for Remotion SSR prevention (cleaner TypeScript than next/dynamic)
- Custom Player controls for design system consistency
- 8 templates across 4 categories (social, business, creative, minimal)
- Static color preview in cards for performance
- PreviewPlayer reuse for animated modal preview
- Server/client component split for searchParams handling (Next.js 15 pattern)
- Template context is informational only (v1) - guides user prompt, doesn't pre-fill props
- @convex-dev/rate-limiter@0.3.2 for render quota enforcement (renamed from ratelimiter)
- Internal mutations for render create/update (security pattern from actions)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flagged: Claude prompt engineering may need iteration if generation quality <60%
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY required for generation testing (documented in USER-SETUP)
- AWS credentials required for Remotion Lambda (to be documented in 05-USER-SETUP)
