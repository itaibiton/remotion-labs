## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Clerk for authentication (fast integration, good UX, 10K MAU free tier)
- Convex for backend (real-time, serverless, pairs well with React)
- Remotion Lambda for rendering (serverless, scales automatically)
- Template-based generation approach for v1.0 (props-based, not full JSX execution)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research flagged: Claude prompt engineering may need iteration if generation quality <60%
- Research flagged: Preview-render divergence tolerance unknown (user acceptance TBD)
