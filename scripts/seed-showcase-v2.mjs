  // --- Kinetic Typography (10) ---
  `A dark navy (#0a0e27) background with the word VELOCITY in white 80px bold sans-serif font centered on screen. Each letter starts 200px above its final position and falls down one by one with 8-frame stagger using spring physics (damping 12, stiffness 100). As each letter lands, a small burst of 6 tiny white particles (3px circles) radiates outward from the letter base with randomized angles, fading to opacity 0 over 15 frames. After all letters land, a thin horizontal line (2px, white) draws itself from left edge to right edge below the text over 20 frames with easeInOut timing.`,

  `Black (#000) background. The phrase THE FUTURE IS NOW displayed in monospace font (Courier style), bright green (#00FF41) color, 36px size. Characters appear one by one from left to right with 3-frame intervals simulating a typewriter. After each character appears, a blinking cursor (a solid green rectangle 2px wide, 36px tall) blinks at the end position, toggling opacity between 1 and 0 every 15 frames. Add faint horizontal scanlines across the entire screen (repeating 1px green lines at 3px intervals, opacity 0.05) for a retro CRT monitor effect. Slight text-shadow glow: 0 0 10px rgba(0,255,65,0.5).`,

  `Charcoal (#1a1a2e) background. The word IMAGINE in 120px ultra-bold font. Each letter is individually wrapped and colored in a gradient sequence: I(#FF0080), M(#FF4D00), A(#FFAA00), G(#00CC66), I(#0088FF), N(#6600FF), E(#CC00FF). All letters start at scale 0 and opacity 0 at center of screen stacked on top of each other. With 8-frame stagger, each letter springs to scale 1 (spring damping: 8, mass: 1) while translating to its final horizontal position in the word. After the word is assembled at frame 70, the entire word slowly rotates from 0 to 3 degrees and back using a sine wave, creating a gentle rocking motion.`,

  `White background. Three lines of text stacked vertically centered: line 1 THINK in 72px bold black, line 2 CREATE in 72px bold electric blue (#2563EB), line 3 SHIP in 72px bold emerald (#10B981). Each line enters from the right (starting at translateX +600px) and slides to center using spring animation (damping: 14), staggered by 20 frames. As each line settles, a subtle underline (3px height, matching text color) wipes in from left to right over 15 frames using scaleX 0 to 1 with transform-origin left. After all three lines are visible, they gently pulse scale from 1.0 to 1.02 and back with staggered sine waves.`,

  `Solid black background. The number counter starts at 000 and counts up to 999 in the center of the screen using a 96px bold monospace white font. The counting uses interpolate mapped to the full frame range. Each digit position (hundreds, tens, ones) has a subtle vertical sliding motion as it changes, like a mechanical counter flipping. Behind the numbers, a thin circular progress ring (radius 160px, stroke-width 4px, color #3B82F6) draws itself clockwise from 12 oclock using stroke-dashoffset animation, completing the full circle as the counter reaches 999. Add a subtle radial gradient background glow from dark blue (#0c1445) at center fading to black at edges.`,

  `Dark background (#0f0f23). The text PIXEL ART in blocky 80px font with letter-spacing 8px. Each letter is built from tiny 8x8px squares that assemble like Tetris pieces falling from above. The squares for each letter fall independently from random positions at the top of the screen, settling into their correct grid positions with 2-frame stagger per square. Use spring animation (damping: 20) for landing. Total assembly takes about 60 frames. Once complete, the entire text glows with a pulsing neon effect: text-shadow cycling between 0 0 10px #0ff and 0 0 30px #0ff over 30-frame intervals.`,

  `Gradient background from deep teal (#004D40) to dark (#001a14). The word WAVES in 100px white bold font centered. Each letter has an independent vertical oscillation using sine waves with different phase offsets (letter index * 0.8 radians) and amplitude of 20px. The frequency is calibrated so one full wave cycle takes 60 frames. Additionally, each letters opacity subtly oscillates between 0.7 and 1.0 with the same phase offset, creating a ripple-like brightness wave traveling across the word. Below the text, three horizontal wavy lines (SVG paths or div-based) in white at 30% opacity animate with matching wave motion but offset phases.`,

  `Pure white background. A single sentence appears word by word: Design is not just what it looks like. Each word fades in (opacity 0 to 1) and slides up (translateY 15px to 0) over 12 frames, with 10-frame stagger between words. The font is 32px serif (Georgia style), dark charcoal (#222) color. The final three words and feels like appear 20 frames after the rest, in italic style and colored #6366F1. After the full sentence is visible (around frame 100), a small dash and the attribution Steve Jobs fades in below in 16px gray (#999) over 15 frames.`,

  `Split screen: left half pure black, right half pure white. On the black half, the word LIGHT in 64px bold white font slides in from the left (translateX -200 to center) over 25 frames with easeOut. On the white half, the word DARK in 64px bold black font slides in from the right (translateX +200 to center) over 25 frames with easeOut, starting 10 frames after LIGHT. At frame 50, the backgrounds swap (black becomes white, white becomes black) over 15 frames using opacity cross-fade, and the text colors invert simultaneously. The dividing center line is 2px wide and fades from gray to transparent during the swap.`,

  `Warm beige (#FFF8F0) background. A motivational quote layout: large opening quotation mark in 120px #E5E0D8 at top-left area. Below it, the text Every moment is a fresh beginning in 40px dark brown (#3D2C1E) serif font, line-height 1.4. The text has a staggered letter reveal where each character fades in with 1-frame intervals from left to right over 60 frames. At frame 70, the attribution T.S. Eliot slides up from below (translateY 30 to 0) with fade-in, in 18px italic #8B7355. A thin decorative line (1px, #D4C5B2, 120px wide) appears between quote and attribution with a scale-x wipe animation.`,

  // --- Geometric / Abstract (10) ---
  `Black background. Five concentric circles centered on screen with radii 40, 80, 120, 160, 200px. Each circle is a 2px stroke, no fill. Colors from inner to outer: #FF006E, #FB5607, #FFBE0B, #06D6A0, #118AB2. Each circle starts at scale 0 and expands to its full size with spring animation (damping: 10), staggered by 8 frames from inner to outer. After all circles reach full size at around frame 60, they begin a continuous rotation: odd-indexed circles rotate clockwise, even-indexed counter-clockwise, each at 1 degree per frame. The circles have opacity 0.8 and a subtle glow via box-shadow matching their color.`,

  `Dark gray (#111) background. A 5x5 grid of squares (50px each, 16px gap) centered on screen. Each square is white with rounded corners (8px). Animation: starting from the center square, a wave of color propagates outward in a diamond pattern. Each square transitions from white to a vibrant color (#FF3366) over 10 frames, then back to white over 10 frames — creating a ping effect. The wave speed is 4 frames delay per distance-step from center. The wave repeats continuously. Each squares scale also bumps from 1.0 to 1.15 and back during its colored phase, adding a physical pop feeling.`,

  `Pure black background. A Lissajous curve drawn by a moving white dot (6px). The parametric equations use x = 250 * sin(3t) and y = 250 * cos(2t) where t goes from 0 to 2*PI over the full duration, centered on screen. The dot leaves a trail of 60 previous positions that fade linearly from white (opacity 1) to transparent. The trail dots decrease in size from 6px to 1px. The entire figure slowly rotates at 0.5 degrees per frame around the center point. Add a very subtle blue (#0066FF at 0.15 opacity) radial gradient glow at the center of the screen, radius 300px.`,

  `White background. A single equilateral triangle (side 200px) centered on screen, drawn with 3px black stroke, no fill. The triangle starts at scale 0 and springs to full size (damping: 12). At frame 30, the triangle splits into 4 smaller triangles (Sierpinski-style first iteration) by drawing three internal lines connecting midpoints over 20 frames. Each of the 4 resulting triangles gets a different fill color fading in: #FF6B6B, #4ECDC4, #45B7D1, #FFA07A, at 40% opacity. The outer stroke remains black. At frame 70, the entire figure rotates 60 degrees with easeInOut over 20 frames.`,

  `Midnight blue (#0D1B2A) background. 80 particles (small circles, 2-5px random sizes) positioned randomly across the screen. Each particle is white with opacity between 0.3 and 0.8. Particles that are within 120px of each other are connected by thin lines (1px, white, opacity proportional to distance — closer means more opaque, max 0.3). All particles drift slowly in random directions (0.3-0.8px per frame) with slight randomness using random() seeds. When particles reach screen edges they wrap around to the other side. This creates a living constellation / network graph effect. Add a subtle blue glow (#1E88E5, opacity 0.1) behind clusters of 3+ connected particles.`,

  `Light gray (#F5F5F5) background. A golden spiral visualization: starting from center, draw connected quarter-circle arcs that grow according to the Fibonacci sequence. Use rectangles as guidelines (visible as 1px light gray strokes). The spiral line itself is 3px, colored warm gold (#D4A017). The spiral draws itself progressively from the smallest arc outward over 70 frames using stroke-dashoffset animation. Each new arc segment draws over 10 frames. As each Fibonacci rectangle completes, it gets a subtle fill color at 5% opacity alternating between warm and cool tones. The spiral should complete about 8 quarter turns.`,

  `Black background. A single horizontal line of 20 circles (12px diameter each, 8px gap), centered vertically and horizontally. Initial color: all dark gray (#333). A wave of illumination travels from left to right continuously: each circle lights up to bright white (#FFF) with a glow (box-shadow: 0 0 15px white) as the wave passes, then fades back to dark gray. The wave takes 40 frames to cross all 20 circles, then 20 frames of darkness before repeating. Each illuminated circle also scales from 1.0 to 1.3 and back. The wave creates a smooth sine-based brightness falloff, not a hard on/off — circles near the wave center are brightest, with 3-4 circles on either side partially lit.`,

  `Deep purple (#13052A) background. Three rotating rings centered on screen: outer ring radius 180px with 12 small circles (8px, #FF006E) evenly spaced, middle ring radius 120px with 8 circles (8px, #FFBE0B), inner ring radius 60px with 6 circles (8px, #06D6A0). The outer ring rotates clockwise at 1 degree/frame, middle counter-clockwise at 1.5 degrees/frame, inner clockwise at 2 degrees/frame. Each small circle pulses opacity between 0.5 and 1.0 with sine waves at different phases. When circles from different rings pass close to each other (within 30px), their connecting line briefly appears (1px, white, 20% opacity) for a momentary connection effect.`,

  `White background. A morphing blob: start with a perfect circle (radius 100px) centered on screen, filled with a linear gradient from #667EEA to #764BA2. The circle continuously morphs by applying sinusoidal perturbations to its border-radius: using 8-value border-radius shorthand where each value oscillates between 30% and 70% with different sine frequencies and phases, changing every frame. This creates an organic, amoeba-like shape that flows and breathes. The gradient angle also slowly rotates from 0 to 360 degrees over the full duration. Add a subtle drop shadow (0 10px 40px rgba(102,126,234,0.3)) that follows the shape.`,

  `Charcoal (#1C1C1E) background. A visual metronome: a vertical line (3px wide, 200px tall, white) anchored at its top-center of screen. The line swings left and right like a pendulum, rotating from -30 degrees to +30 degrees with easeInOut timing, completing one full swing (left to right to left) every 60 frames. At the bottom tip of the pendulum, a circle (16px, #FF3B30) traces an arc path. At each extreme position (leftmost and rightmost), a brief flash: a small ring expands from the tip from 16px to 40px radius while fading from opacity 1 to 0 over 8 frames, colored #FF3B30. A horizontal baseline (1px, white, 30% opacity) indicates the rest position.`,

  // --- Data Visualization (10) ---
  `White background with 20px padding. Title Monthly Revenue in 22px bold #1F2937 at top-left. Below, a line chart area: X-axis shows Jan through Jun as labels in 12px #6B7280, Y-axis shows $0K to $50K in 12px #6B7280 with 4 gridlines (1px #F3F4F6). The data line connects points: Jan $12K, Feb $19K, Mar $15K, Apr $28K, May $35K, Jun $42K. The line (3px, #6366F1) draws itself left to right over 60 frames using stroke-dashoffset. Below the line, a gradient fill (#6366F1 at 20% opacity to transparent) fades in after the line completes. Each data point gets a white-filled circle with #6366F1 border (6px) that pops in with spring scale animation as the line reaches it.`,

  `Light background (#FAFAFA). A horizontal grouped bar chart comparing Q1 vs Q2 for 4 departments. Each group has two bars side by side: Q1 (#6366F1) and Q2 (#EC4899). Departments top to bottom: Engineering (Q1: 85%, Q2: 92%), Design (Q1: 70%, Q2: 88%), Marketing (Q1: 60%, Q2: 75%), Sales (Q1: 90%, Q2: 95%). Bars grow from left to right with easeOutCubic over 20 frames, staggered by 12 frames per department group. Each bar has its percentage value displayed at its right end in 13px bold matching color. Department labels on the left in 14px #374151. A legend at top-right shows colored squares with Q1/Q2 labels, fading in first.`,

  `Dark background (#111827). A radial/radar chart with 6 axes equally spaced (60 degrees apart) labeled: Speed, Power, Range, Defense, Agility, Magic. Labels in 12px #9CA3AF at each axis tip. Three concentric hexagonal gridlines at 33%, 66%, 100% in 1px #374151. The data polygon connects points at: Speed 90%, Power 60%, Range 75%, Defense 85%, Agility 95%, Magic 70%. The polygon fills with #8B5CF6 at 25% opacity and has a 2px #8B5CF6 stroke. Animation: each vertex starts at center (0%) and springs outward to its final percentage over 40 frames with 5-frame stagger going clockwise. The fill fades in after all vertices reach position.`,

  `White background. An animated pie chart with 5 segments centered on screen (radius 140px). Segments: Social Media (#FF6384, 30%), Email (#36A2EB, 25%), Search (#FFCE56, 20%), Direct (#4BC0C0, 15%), Referral (#9966FF, 10%). Each segment draws in clockwise using stroke-dashoffset over 18 frames, staggered sequentially with no gap. As each segment completes, its label line extends outward (a thin 1px line from segment center to 180px from center) over 8 frames, followed by the label text (name and percentage in 13px) fading in. The entire chart has a slight rotation animation, starting from -90 degrees (so first segment begins at top).`,

  `Warm white (#FFFDF7) background. Four horizontal progress bars stacked vertically with 32px spacing, centered. Each bar is 400px wide, 20px tall with 10px border-radius. Labels above each bar in 14px #374151: JavaScript (92%), Python (78%), Rust (65%), Go (54%). The bar backgrounds are #F3F4F6. Fill colors: JS(#F7DF1E), Python(#3776AB), Rust(#CE422B), Go(#00ADD8). Bars fill from left to right with easeOutQuart timing over 30 frames each, staggered by 15 frames. As each bar fills, the percentage number on the right side counts up from 0% to its target. A small checkmark icon appears after each bar completes filling, popping in with spring scale.`,

  `Dark blue (#0F172A) background. A treemap visualization with 8 rectangles of varying sizes filling a 700x400px area. Each rectangle represents a category with size proportional to value. Categories with colors: Tech (#6366F1, largest), Health (#10B981), Finance (#F59E0B), Energy (#EF4444), Media (#8B5CF6), Retail (#EC4899), Auto (#06B6D4), Food (#84CC16, smallest). Each rectangle starts at 0 opacity and scale 0.8, then fades in and scales to 1.0 with 6-frame stagger from largest to smallest. After all visible, the category name (white, 14px bold) and value (white, 11px, 60% opacity) appear inside each rectangle with a typewriter fade effect. 2px dark gap between all rectangles.`,

  `White background. An animated scatter plot: 600x400px chart area with thin gray axes. X-axis labeled Hours Studied (0-10), Y-axis labeled Test Score (0-100). 25 data points at realistic-looking positions showing positive correlation. Each point is a circle (8px) colored #6366F1 with 60% opacity. Points fall in from the top of the chart to their Y positions one at a time with 3-frame stagger, using spring physics (damping: 15) for a bouncy landing. After all points land, a trend line (2px, #EF4444, dashed) draws itself from bottom-left to top-right over 20 frames showing the positive correlation. Axis labels are 12px #6B7280.`,

  `Light gray (#F8FAFC) background. A funnel chart visualization: 5 horizontal trapezoid bands stacked vertically, widest on top (600px) narrowing to smallest at bottom (200px). Stages top to bottom: Visitors (#3B82F6, 10000), Sign Ups (#6366F1, 5200), Active Users (#8B5CF6, 2800), Paid (#A855F7, 890), Enterprise (#C084FC, 210). Each band has its label centered in white bold 14px with count below in 12px white 80% opacity. Bands slide in from the left one by one with 12-frame stagger and easeOutBack timing. After each band appears, a small conversion rate label (e.g. 52%) appears between bands on the right side, fading in over 8 frames.`,

  `Dark background (#18181B). A real-time-style stock chart. A green line (#22C55E, 2px) draws from left to right plotting an upward-trending stock price with realistic random fluctuations (use random() with incremental seeds for each point, biased upward). The chart fills 80% of screen width. Below the line, a gradient fill from #22C55E at 15% opacity to transparent. Current price shown in top-right: $142.58 in 28px bold green, with +5.3% below it in 16px green. A thin gray horizontal dashed line shows the opening price level at about 70% height. X-axis has time labels every 20% (9:30, 10:00, 10:30, 11:00, 11:30) in 11px gray.`,

  `White background. A circular gauge/speedometer centered on screen. Outer ring is a thick (12px) arc from 220 degrees to 320 degrees (total 260 degrees of arc), creating a gauge shape. The arc background is #E5E7EB. The filled portion animates from 0 to 73% of the arc in #6366F1, drawing over 40 frames with easeOutQuart. Inside the gauge, the number 73 counts up from 0 in 48px bold #111827, with the unit percent below in 16px #6B7280. A needle (thin triangle, 3px, dark gray) rotates from the start of the arc to the 73% position matching the fill animation. Small tick marks (every 10%) are drawn around the outside of the arc in 1px #D1D5DB.`,

  // --- Logo and Brand (10) ---
  `Black background. A circle (radius 80px, 3px white stroke, no fill) centered on screen draws itself using stroke-dashoffset from top (12 oclock) clockwise over 30 frames with easeInOut. At frame 35, inside the circle, a simplified lightning bolt shape (made of 3 connected line segments forming a Z-like zigzag) draws itself stroke-by-stroke over 20 frames in bright yellow (#FBBF24). The bolt has 3px stroke. At frame 60, a brief flash effect: a white circle at 80% opacity expands from the bolt center from 0 to 300px radius while fading to 0 over 12 frames. After the flash, the logo remains with a subtle pulsing glow on the bolt (box-shadow oscillating).`,

  `Deep navy (#0A192F) background. Two overlapping circles (radius 60px each), one positioned 40px left of center, one 40px right. Both have 2px stroke in white, no fill. They start overlapping at center and slide apart over 25 frames with easeOut. As they separate, the text STUDIO in 24px bold tracking-widest white appears in the space between them, fading in from opacity 0 to 1 over 15 frames starting at frame 20. Below the circles and text, a thin line (1px, white, 50% opacity) draws itself from left circle edge to right circle edge over 20 frames starting at frame 30. The whole logo then has a subtle breathing scale animation (1.0 to 1.02) using sine wave.`,

  `White background. The letter A constructed as an architectural blueprint. A grid of very faint blue (#C5D8E8) lines covers the background. The letter A is drawn with three separate line segments (left diagonal, right diagonal, horizontal crossbar) in dark blue (#1A365D), 4px stroke. Each segment draws itself using stroke-dashoffset over 15 frames, staggered by 10 frames. Small dimension annotation arrows and numbers appear alongside the strokes: height 120px, width 80px labels in 10px #4A6FA5. Construction circles at the apex and base points (8px, 1px stroke, #4A6FA5) fade in as each relevant stroke completes. Title ARCHITECTS below in 14px tracking-wide #1A365D fades in last.`,

  `Black background. Three rounded rectangles (120x40px, border-radius 12px, 2px stroke, no fill). They start scattered: one at top-left rotated -20deg, one at bottom-right rotated 15deg, one at top-right rotated 30deg. Colors: #FF006E, #00D4FF, #FFBE0B. All three simultaneously animate to center, overlapping with slight offsets (0px, -8px, +8px vertically) while rotating to 0 degrees, over 30 frames with spring animation (damping: 12). They form a unified stacked-cards logo mark. At frame 45, the background of each rectangle fills in with its stroke color at 15% opacity over 15 frames. The text STACK appears below in 20px white bold at frame 50, fading in over 10 frames.`,

  `Soft gradient background from #FFF5F5 to #FFF0F6 (warm rose tones). A heart shape centered on screen, drawn as an SVG path or constructed from two rotated rounded squares. The heart is colored #FF1744, 80px tall. The heart performs a rhythmic beating animation: scale 1.0 to 1.15 to 1.0 to 1.12 to 1.0 mimicking a real heartbeat double-pulse, each cycle taking 40 frames. A horizontal ECG-style line draws itself from left to right across the middle of the screen in #FF1744 (2px), showing flat line then a spike synchronized with each heartbeat. The ECG line scrolls continuously. Below the heart, VITALS in 16px tracking-wide #FF1744 at 60% opacity.`,

  `Dark (#0D1117) background. An audio equalizer logo: 7 vertical bars centered horizontally at the bottom third of screen. Each bar is 8px wide with 6px gaps, colored #1DB954 (Spotify green). Heights animate continuously: each bar oscillates between a random minimum (20-40px) and maximum (60-140px) height using sine waves with different frequencies (creating a music visualization look). The bars have rounded tops (border-radius 4px 4px 0 0). Above the bars, the text NOW PLAYING in 12px tracking-widest #1DB954 at 70% opacity appears at frame 15 with fade-in. A thin progress bar (2px, #1DB954) at the very bottom fills from left to right over the full duration.`,

  `White background. A startup launch sequence: a simplified rocket icon (triangle on top of rectangle, small triangle fins at base) positioned at bottom-center, colored #6366F1, 60px tall. From frame 0-20: subtle vibration (random translateX between -2px and 2px). From frame 20-50: rocket translates upward 400px with easing (slow start, fast end using cubic bezier). A gradient trail extends below the rocket: a rectangle from the rocket base to the bottom that is #F97316 at top fading to transparent, width tapering from 20px to 40px. At frame 50 when rocket reaches top area, the text LAUNCH in 36px bold white appears at center with scale spring animation. Two small star sparkles (4-pointed) appear flanking the text.`,

  `Dark teal (#003135) background. A code editor mockup: a rounded rectangle (500x300px) with dark (#1E1E1E) fill and 1px #333 border centered on screen. At top, three traffic light dots (12px): red #FF5F56, yellow #FFBD2E, green #27C93F, spaced 8px apart. Below, lines of code appear one by one: line 1 in blue #569CD6 (const), line 2 in green #6A9955 (a comment), line 3 in orange #CE9178 (a string), line 4 in white #D4D4D4 (regular code), line 5 in purple #C586C0 (keyword). Each line types in character by character at 2-frame intervals. A blinking cursor follows the typing. Tab title CODE.STUDIO in 11px #888 appears at the very top.`,

  `Gradient background from #0F0C29 via #302B63 to #24243E. A play button triangle (equilateral, 80px side) centered, filled white. The triangle starts at scale 0 and springs to scale 1 (damping: 10) over 25 frames. At frame 30, two concentric circles (2px stroke, white) expand outward from behind the triangle: inner circle from 40px to 120px radius while fading from 0.6 to 0 opacity over 20 frames, outer circle same but starts 8 frames later and goes to 160px. This radar-ping repeats once more starting at frame 60. The triangle has a constant subtle shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(255,255,255,0.2). Text PLAY below triangle in 16px white tracking-wide fades in at frame 40.`,

  `Clean white background. A minimal clock face: outer circle 200px radius, 2px stroke #E5E7EB. 12 tick marks (small lines, 3px, #374151) at each hour position drawn with staggered fade-in (2-frame stagger clockwise from 12). After ticks appear, a minute hand (100px long, 2px, #374151) and hour hand (70px long, 3px, #111827) rotate from the center. The minute hand completes a full 360-degree rotation over the entire duration. The hour hand moves at 1/12th that speed. A small center dot (8px, #111827) marks the pivot. At the very start, the text 10:10 displays below the clock in 16px #6B7280, updating every 30 frames to reflect approximate hand positions. Smooth linear rotation, no easing.`,

  // --- Scenes and Storytelling (10) ---
  `Full-screen sky scene. Background is a vertical gradient that transitions over the duration: starts as morning sky (#87CEEB top to #FDB813 bottom/horizon), transitions through midday (#4A90D9 to #87CEEB), then to sunset (#FF6B35 to #2D1B69), ending at night (#0a0e27 to #1a1a3e). A circle representing the sun (50px, #FFD700 with box-shadow glow) arcs across the top half following a parabolic path from left to right. As the sky darkens past frame 60, the sun shrinks and a moon (40px, #F5F5DC) fades in at the upper right. During the night phase, 20 small stars (2-3px white dots) twinkle in by fading to random opacities between 0.4 and 1.0.`,

  `Dark blue (#0B1929) background representing space. A large yellow-gold circle (#FFD700, 40px radius, with 0 0 30px glow) sits at center as the sun. Six planets orbit at different distances: Mercury (6px, #B5B5B5, radius 60px orbit, fastest), Venus (8px, #E8CDA0, 90px), Earth (8px, #4A90D9, 120px), Mars (7px, #C1440E, 155px), Jupiter (14px, #C88B3A, 200px), Saturn (12px, #E8D5A3, 250px with a thin ring). Each planet orbits at decreasing angular velocities (Mercury fastest, Saturn slowest). Orbits shown as 1px #1E3A5F circles. All motion is smooth and continuous using frame-based trigonometry (cos/sin for x/y positions).`,

  `Scene background: gradient from light blue (#87CEEB) top 40% to dark green (#228B22) bottom 40% with a brown (#8B4513) strip as ground. A city skyline silhouette: 8 rectangles of varying widths (30-80px) and heights (100-300px) in dark charcoal (#1C1C1E), positioned along the bottom, rising from the ground. Each building grows upward (scaleY from 0 to 1, transform-origin bottom) with spring animation staggered 8 frames apart from left to right. Some buildings have small yellow rectangle windows (4x4px) that light up randomly after the building finishes growing. Above the skyline, 5 stars fade in during the last 30 frames.`,

  `A loading/progress sequence that tells a story. Frame 0-25: dark background, text Connecting... in 16px white with a 3-dot loading animation (dots fade in/out sequentially). Frame 25-50: background transitions to dark green (#064E3B), text changes to Downloading... with a horizontal progress bar (300px wide, 8px tall, fills from 0% to 100% with #10B981). Frame 50-75: background transitions to dark blue (#1E3A5F), text changes to Processing... with a spinning circle loader (30px, 3px #3B82F6 stroke, animated rotation). Frame 75-90: background flashes white briefly then settles to black, a checkmark (green #22C55E, drawn with two strokes) appears at center with the text Complete! in 20px white below it.`,

  `Ocean scene. Background: gradient from light blue (#7EC8E3) at top to deep blue (#1B4965) at bottom. Three layers of sine-wave shapes represent water. Back wave: large gentle sine (amplitude 20px, wavelength 400px), color #1B6B93 at 80% opacity, moves slowly rightward (2px per frame). Middle wave: medium sine (amplitude 15px, wavelength 250px), color #2E8BC0 at 70% opacity, moves rightward faster (3px per frame). Front wave: small choppy sine (amplitude 10px, wavelength 150px), color #5DB5D5 at 90% opacity, moves rightward fastest (5px per frame). Each wave is a filled shape from its sine curve down to the bottom of screen. A simple white sailboat triangle (30px) sits on the middle wave, bobbing with its motion.`,

  `Night sky fireworks show on black (#0a0a0a) background. Three rockets launch sequentially with 25-frame gaps. Each rocket: a small bright dot (4px) that travels upward from bottom-center (varied X positions: left, center, right) over 20 frames with decelerating speed. At apex, the dot disappears and an explosion of 24 particles bursts outward in a circle. Particles are 3px dots in the rockets color (rocket 1: #FF006E, rocket 2: #FFBE0B, rocket 3: #00D4FF). Particles travel outward 80-120px using random() for slight variation, while fading from opacity 1 to 0 and scaling from 1 to 0.3 over 30 frames. Add slight gravity: particles translateY increases quadratically after burst.`,

  `Retro pixel game over screen. Background: solid dark blue (#00004d). Large text GAME OVER in blocky pixel-style font (simulated with 6px letter-spacing and sharp edges), 56px, #FF0000, centered vertically at 35% from top. The text drops in from above with 2 bounces (translateY from -200 to 0 with damping 8). Below it, SCORE: followed by a number that rapidly counts from 0 to 28450 over 40 frames in 28px #FFFFFF. Below the score at 70% from top, INSERT COIN blinks on and off with 20-frame intervals in 18px #FFD700. A border of 4px white lines frames the screen at 16px inset. Small star decorations (4 of them, using asterisk or dots) in corners pulse scale.`,

  `Animated weather card on a clean light blue (#EBF5FF) background. A centered rounded rectangle (320x200px, border-radius 20px, white fill, subtle shadow). At top of card: a sun icon (yellow #F59E0B circle 30px with 8 small ray lines extending outward, rotating slowly at 0.5 deg/frame). Temperature 72F in 48px bold #1F2937 centered. Below: Sunny in 16px #6B7280. At the bottom of the card, a row of 5 mini forecast columns (Mon-Fri) with tiny weather icons (circles) and temperatures (68-75 range) in 11px #9CA3AF. The card enters from below (translateY 60 to 0) with spring animation over 25 frames. Internal elements fade in with 5-frame stagger after card lands.`,

  `A notification popup animation. Background: light gray (#F4F4F5). A card (360px wide, 80px tall, white, rounded-xl, shadow-lg) starts above the viewport (translateY: -120px) and slides down to 40px from top with spring animation (damping: 14) at frame 5. The card contains: left side has a blue circle (36px, #3B82F6) with a white bell icon (simplified: a trapezoid shape). Center has title New Message in 14px bold #111827, and subtitle You have 3 unread messages in 12px #6B7280. Right side has a timestamp 2m ago in 11px #9CA3AF. After 50 frames of being visible, the card slides back up (translateY to -120px) over 15 frames with easeIn timing, simulating an auto-dismiss notification.`,

  `A toggle switch interaction. Light gray (#F5F5F5) background. Centered: a pill-shaped track (56px wide, 28px tall, border-radius 14px). Initially the track is #D1D5DB (gray) and the knob is a white circle (24px, positioned left, with subtle shadow). From frame 20-35: the knob slides from left to right (translateX 0 to 28px) with spring animation (damping: 16). Simultaneously, the track background color transitions from #D1D5DB to #22C55E (green). From frame 35-50: a small checkmark draws itself inside the knob using two short strokes in #22C55E. Text below the toggle changes from Off (14px #9CA3AF) to On (14px #22C55E bold), cross-fading over 10 frames during the transition.`,
